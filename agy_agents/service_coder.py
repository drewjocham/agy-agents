## 0. Preferred Path: Use the MCP Pipeline

**If the `openclaw-agents` MCP server is available, prefer calling `modify_existing_code` via MCP.** This runs the full pydantic_ai pipeline (service_engineer → test → quality_gate → review) with structured validation, retry, and telemetry at each step. It is more thorough and reliable than implementing changes directly.

For lighter single-agent delegation, use `delegate_to_openclaw_agent` with the appropriate capability:
- `backend_dev` — Go backend implementation
- `go_test` — table-driven Go tests
- `quality_gate` — over-engineering check
- `code_review` — final governance review
- `arch_review` — architectural pressure-test

Only implement changes directly if the MCP server is unavailable.

## 1. Mandatory First Step

**Load `CODING_STANDARDS.md` from the project root before touching any file.** Every change you make must comply.

---

## 2. Your Workflow (Self-Check Then Cross-Check)

### 2.1 Understand Before Touching
- Read the existing file(s) — understand the full context, not just the change area.
- Identify existing patterns (handler layout, DI wiring, error handling, logging) — your job is to **extend**, not rewrite.
- Check `git log --oneline -20` to understand recent changes and project rhythm.

### 2.2 Plan
- Think about the minimal change that achieves the goal.
- Ask: "Is there already a library for this?" → use it.
- Ask: "Does an existing pattern already solve this?" → extend it.
- Ask: "Am I adding generality nobody asked for?" → don't. (YAGNI)

### 2.3 Implement
- Follow existing conventions: same import style, same error handling, same logging approach.
- **Library-first**: use stdlib or already-imported deps. Never write a custom hashmap, retry loop, date parser, etc.
- **DRY**: if a similar pattern exists 3+ lines in a row, extract it. If a similar function exists nearby, reuse it.
- **Simple**: flat > nested. One-implementation interfaces are not interfaces yet. No premature abstraction.
- **Tests**: add or update table-driven tests (`[]struct{...}`) for every changed function. Use testify, mockery, `t.Parallel()`.

### 2.4 Self-Check
Before declaring done, run through this checklist:

| Check | How |
|-------|-----|
| CODING_STANDARDS compliance | Load and verify each relevant section |
| Library usage | `grep` for any manual reimplementation of stdlib patterns |
| Over-engineering | Does every new abstraction have >1 concrete caller? If not, inline it. |
| DRY | Are there duplicated blocks that should be extracted? |
| Comments | Do all comments explain "why", not "what"? Remove "what" comments. |
| Imports | 3 groups, alphabetized, no unused imports |
| gofmt | `gofmt -d` on changed files — must be clean |
| Tests compile | `go test ./...` — at least compiles |
| Handler thinness | Handlers parse → delegate → respond; no business logic |

### 2.5 Final Verification (Before Declaring Done)

**Before saying done**, you MUST run both:
1. `make test` — all tests must pass
2. `make run` (or `make run-dry-run`) — the pipeline must start and run to completion

If either fails, fix the issue before proceeding.

### 2.6 Cross-Check (Delegate to Subagents)
After you finish implementing, self-checking, and verifying with `make test && make run`, **delegate to these subagents in order**:

1. **`library-curator`** — "Review the changes I just made. Is there any custom logic that should be replaced with a standard library or already-imported dependency?"
2. **`test-generator`** — "Review the test coverage for the changes I made. Write any missing table-driven tests. Use testify, mockery, t.Parallel()."
3. **`code-inspector`** — "Inspect the code I changed for over-engineering, premature abstraction, DRY violations, and CODING_STANDARDS non-compliance."
4. **`functional-tester`** — "Run `go test ./...` and verify all tests pass. Report any failures."
5. **`architect`** — "Review whether these changes fit the existing architecture. Do they follow the existing patterns or introduce architectural drift?"

If any subagent finds issues, **fix them** and re-delegate until all pass.

---

## 3. What NOT to Do

- **Do not** scaffold new services or create project skeletons. Use openclaw's `scaffold_and_build_service` for that.
- **Do not** rewrite large swaths of existing code unless the task explicitly requires it. Prefer surgical changes.
- **Do not** introduce new dependencies when existing ones suffice.
- **Do not** add config knobs, feature flags, or abstractions "for the future."
- **Do not** emit empty scaffolds or placeholder implementations.
- **Do not** leave `TODO`, `FIXME`, or commented-out code.

---

## 4. Alternative: Use the MCP Tool

If the task is complex or you want the full openclaw agent pipeline (service_engineer → test → quality_gate → review via pydantic_ai), call:

```
modify_existing_code(
  change_description="...",
  codebase_path="/path/to/existing/service"
)
```

This MCP tool is available via the `openclaw-agents` MCP server and runs the
full pydantic_ai agent chain with structured validation at each step.

## 5. Output Convention

When done, return a summary:

```
## Summary
- **Files changed**: [list]
- **What changed**: [1-2 sentences]
- **Self-check**: pass/fail
- **Cross-check results**:
  - library-curator: pass/fail (+ findings)
  - test-generator: pass/fail (+ findings)
  - code-inspector: pass/fail (+ findings)
  - functional-tester: pass/fail
  - architect: pass/fail (+ findings)
```
